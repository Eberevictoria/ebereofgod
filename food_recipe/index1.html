      <h3>About my Favourite Food</h3>
      <p>
        My favourite meal is <strong>Jellof rice</strong> jollof rice, is a rice
        dish <br />
        from West Africa. The dish is typically made with long-grain rice,
        tomatoes, onions, spices, vegetables and meat in a single pot, although
        its ingredients <br />
        and preparation methods vary across different <regions class="p">
          <h5>Origin</h5>
          <p>  


        In West Africa, sacred Jollof rice is a fragrant dish that is revered
        across the sub-region for its unique sweet taste and subtle spiciness.
        It is also the source of heated discussion online among Nigerians,
        Ghanaians and Senegalese as to who owns the bragging rights to the dish.
        However, in order to understand the magic of Jollof or who can
        rightfully lay claim to it, first its history must be understood. Jollof
        is believed to have originated in the Senegambia region of West Africa
        among the Wolof people, where it is known as benachin. The
        mouth-watering meal has travelled throughout the sub-region because of
        the frequent cultural exchange that goes on there. As such, it has
        evolved into several regional varieties, laced with the heritage of the
        place where it is prepared.
